Note: Step 8 below is optional (mentioned just to show the manual way of creating an index), if you have an active tenant (robots connected and sending logs to orchestrator then orchestrator creates the required index on its own)
 8. Create a index for default tenant and post a test message by navigating to Management> Dev Tools> Run the following (CHANGE DATE/MONTH/YEAR FOR TIMESTAMP FIELD BELOW)
    POST default-2022.09\logEvent
{
